<h1>
Sentiment Analysis
</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
This project was born out of our curiosity to delve into the world of machine learning. We wanted to explore what all could be possible given a simple peice of code, a little data, and some help from our professors. We ended up with a fairly accurate sentiment analysis machine which can differentiate between positive and negative sentiments when given a sentence.
